Algorithm for 8-Puzzle Solver Using BFS and Misplaced Tiles Heuristic:
1. Define the Node Class
Input: A state of the 8-puzzle, the parent node, the move to reach the node, and the number of misplaced tiles.

Process:

Define a Node class that stores the current state of the board (state), the parent node (parent), the move made to reach this state (move), and the number of misplaced tiles (misplaced).
This will help track the puzzle's current configuration, how it was reached, and how close it is to the solution.
Output: A Node instance.

2. Misplaced Tiles Heuristic Calculation
Input: Two puzzle states: the current state and the goal state.

Process:

Define the function misplaced_tiles(state, goal) that counts the number of misplaced tiles by comparing each tile in the current state with the corresponding tile in the goal state.
Skip counting for the empty space (denoted by 0).
Loop through the positions of the puzzle, and if a tile is not 0 and not in the correct position, increment the misplaced tile count.
Output: The number of misplaced tiles.

3. Generate Neighboring States (Possible Moves)
Input: The current state of the puzzle (a list of 9 integers representing the 3x3 puzzle grid).

Process:

Define a function get_neighbors(state) that generates all possible states by moving the empty space (0) in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right.
First, find the position of the empty space (0) in the current state.
For each possible direction (up, down, left, right):
Check if the move is valid (i.e., if it stays within the bounds of the 3x3 grid).
If valid, create a new state by swapping the 0 with the adjacent tile in the corresponding direction.
Add the new state and the move (direction) to a list of possible neighbors.
Output: A list of neighbor states and corresponding moves.

4. Breadth-First Search with Heuristic
Input: The initial state and the goal state of the puzzle.

Process:

Define the function bfs(initial, goal) to perform breadth-first search using the misplaced tiles heuristic.
Initialize:
Create the frontier (a list) and add the initial node (with its misplaced tile count).
Create an empty explored set to track visited states.
Main Loop:
While the frontier is not empty:
Sort the frontier based on the number of misplaced tiles (nodes with fewer misplaced tiles have higher priority).
Remove the first node from the frontier (this node has the fewest misplaced tiles).
Check if the current state matches the goal state:
If yes, reconstruct the path from the initial state to the goal (see step 5).
Add the current state to the explored set.
For each neighboring state (generated in step 3):
If the neighbor state has not been explored, create a new node and add it to the frontier.
If no solution is found, return None.
Output: The node that contains the goal state, or None if no solution exists.

5. Reconstruct the Solution Path
Input: The node containing the goal state.

Process:

Define the function reconstruct_path(node) that traces back the solution from the goal node to the initial node using the parent attribute of each node.
Path Reconstruction:
Initialize an empty list for the path and actions.
Traverse the linked nodes from the goal node to the initial node:
Add each parent node's state to the path list.
Add each node's move to the action list.
Reverse the path and action lists to get the correct order from the initial state to the goal state.
Output: A list of actions (moves) and the sequence of states leading from the initial to the goal state.

6. Input Puzzle State
Input: User input for the initial and goal states.

Process:

Define the function input_state(prompt) that asks the user to input three rows of integers (representing the 3x3 grid).
Convert the input into a list of integers and return it as the puzzle state.
Output: The initial or goal puzzle state.

7. Main Function
Input: User-supplied initial and goal puzzle states.

Process:

Use input_state to get the initial state and goal state from the user.
Call bfs with the initial and goal states to find the solution path.
If a solution is found:
Use reconstruct_path to print the solution path and the sequence of moves.
If no solution is found, display an appropriate message.
Output: The solution path and actions (if a solution exists), or a message indicating that no solution exists.

Detailed Step-by-Step Execution of the Code:
Start the Program:

The user is prompted to input the initial and goal states for the 8-puzzle.
The initial state is a list of 9 integers representing the 3x3 puzzle (e.g., 1 2 3 4 0 5 6 7 8), where 0 represents the empty space.
Misplaced Tiles Heuristic:

The misplaced tiles heuristic function counts the number of tiles that are out of place in the current state compared to the goal state.
BFS Algorithm:

The initial state is added to the frontier with its number of misplaced tiles.
The program loops through the frontier:
Pops the node with the fewest misplaced tiles (priority given to the most promising states).
Generates possible moves by moving the empty space (0).
Adds unexplored neighbor states to the frontier.
The process continues until the goal state is found.
Reconstruct Solution:

Once the goal state is found, the path and sequence of actions are reconstructed by tracing the parent nodes back to the initial state.
The path and actions are printed.
End of Program:

The solution is displayed, or the program indicates that no solution was found.
