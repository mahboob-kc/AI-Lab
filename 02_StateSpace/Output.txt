Enter the adjacency list for each node (type 'done' when finished):
Enter node: A
Enter neighbors of A (comma separated): B,C
Enter node: B
Enter neighbors of B (comma separated): D
Enter node: C
Enter neighbors of C (comma separated): 
Enter node: D
Enter neighbors of D (comma separated): C
Enter node: DONE
Enter the start node: A
Enter the goal node: D
Graph: {'A': ['B', 'C'], 'B': ['D'], 'C': [], 'D': ['C']}
DFS path from A to D: ['A', 'B', 'D']
BFS exploration path from A: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
